<msg type="info" file="Par" num="282" delta="unknown" >No user timing constraints were detected or you have set the option to ignore timing constraints (&quot;par -x&quot;). Place and Route will run in &quot;Performance Evaluation Mode&quot; to automatically improve the performance of all internal clocks in this design. The PAR timing summary will list the performance achieved for each clock. Note: For the fastest runtime, set the effort level to &quot;std&quot;.  For best performance, set the effort level to &quot;high&quot;. For a balance between the fastest runtime and best performance, set the effort level to &quot;med&quot;.

<msg type="warning" file="Route" num="0" delta="unknown" >CLK Net:<arg fmt="%s" index="1">signal_clk</arg> is being routed on general routing resources. If you are trying to use local clocking techniques, evaluate the placement of the clock&apos;s source and loads to ensure it meets the guidelines for local clocking. Otherwise, consider placing this clock on a dedicated clock routing resource. For more information on clock routing resources, see the target architecture&apos;s user guide.
